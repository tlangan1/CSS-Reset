# CSS Reset

[This](https://towardsdev.com/reset-css-and-entirely-personal-recommendations-for-2024-fd7e32e15642) is an article written by someone who does not have a good grasp of the english language but I especially liked the [codepen](https://codepen.io/0ITSUKI0/pen/vYwKoWV?editors=1010) the put together to demonstrate the various industrial strength resets out there including normalize.css

I included an example of an industrial strength reset that can be found [here](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/).
